ASCII code contains total of 127 characters. 127 possible values = 7 bits
so to round off -> 8 bits (1 byte) is taken as char

char is of 1 byte (8 bits)


char temp='A';
// it can only be written within single quotes. Add. It takes one byte of memory.
// it can contain only one character.

char temp = 'AB'; // this is wrong
char temp = "A"; //this is also wrong

// inside the memory only ASCII value is stored. For example, A has Value 65. 
so 65 will be stored in the memory of temp variable

code -->

char temp = 'a';
printf("%c", temp);
//we have given format specifier "%c" , so it will print the char of value of the ASCII code that is stored in the variable

printf("%d", temp); //it will print the ascii code (for ex -> A has ascii code 65)
cout<<temp; //output -> a
